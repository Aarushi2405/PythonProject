  		<h6><p><b>Nobita Nobi</b> is a young boy who suffers from poor grades, frequent bullying and negative emotions like sadness and jealousy. Many years in the future, one of his descendants sends the robotic cat <b>Doraemon</b> back in time to protect and guide Nobita. Doraemon has a <i>four-dimensional pocket</i> in which he stores innumerable items known as <i>gadgets</i>, which range from toys and medicine to technology from the future. Examples include the <i>Bamboo-Copter</i>, a small piece of headgear that allows flight, and the <i>Anywhere Door</i>, a door that opens up to any place the user wishes.</p><p>Nobita's closest friend is <b>Shizuka Minamoto</b>, who also serves as his romantic interest and eventually becomes his wife. Nobita is usually tormented by the bullying <b>Takeshi Goda</b> (nicknamed "Gian"), and the cunning and arrogant <b>Suneo Honekawa</b>. A typical story consists of Doraemon using one of his gadgets in order to assist Nobita in various ways, often causing more trouble than he was trying to solve.</p></h6>
